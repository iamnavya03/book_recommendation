# book_recommendation
This book recommendation model suggests books based on a genre or theme you input. Using TF-IDF and FAISS, it analyzes titles, authors, categories, and descriptions to find the most relevant matches. Users can choose how many recommendations they want, receiving ranked results with key details like title, author, category, and year.

## Overview
This project implements a book recommendation system using both metadata and textual features to suggest books users are likely to enjoy. It leverages Python, pandas, and machine learning techniques for natural language and metadata analysis. The system processes a comprehensive dataset of books including information such as titles, authors, average ratings, descriptions, and embeddings generated from textual content.[8]

## Dataset
The system uses a dataset containing over 6,000 books, with each entry providing:
- ISBN numbers (13/10 digits)
- Title, subtitle, authors
- Categories (genre or subject tags)
- Description (summarized content)
- Published year, average rating, number of pages, ratings count
- Textual and vector embeddings of book metadata for similarity analysis.[8]

## Features
- Cleans and preprocesses book metadata.
- Extracts and encodes text using TF-IDF and sentence embeddings.
- Computes similarity between books using multiple features.
- Recommends books based on user input, metadata, and text similarity.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Install required dependencies with pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
   ```
3. For advanced NLP embeddings, install:
   ```bash
   pip install sentence-transformers
   ```

## Usage

1. Open `book_recommendation.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Run each cell sequentially; modify recommendation logic or data cleaning steps as desired.
3. Input book title/metadata to receive recommendations with details on similarity and relevance.

## Project Structure

| File/Folder              | Description                                       |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| book_recommendation.ipynb| Main notebook (data processing, modeling, output) [8]|
| data/                    | Contains book metadata and embeddings             |
| requirements.txt         | List of required Python packages                  |
| README.md                | Project documentation (this file)                 |

## Results
The notebook outputs a set of book recommendations for each input, showing highly relevant matches based on both metadata and textual content. Sample evaluation metrics are included, but further improvements and assessment may be added.[8]

## Future Work
- Integrate advanced text models (BERT, GPT embeddings).
- Improve personalization using user preferences and feedback.
- Enhance evaluation metrics and add visualization for recommendations.
- Expand dataset and support for multilingual recommendations.
